# Ryan O'Connor Personal Site

React + Vite single-page portfolio, designed for GitHub Pages.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repo and push this project.
2. Run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

3. In GitHub repo settings, set Pages source to `gh-pages` branch (root).

The Vite `base` is set to `./` so asset paths work on project pages.
